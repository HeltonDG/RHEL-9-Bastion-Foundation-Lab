# Roadmap (Platform Evolution)

This bastion-based architecture is intended to serve as a stable foundation for progressively more advanced Linux administration and security scenarios.

The network design and trust boundaries will remain intentionally consistent while future work focuses on operational depth within the internal server environment.

## Near-Term Focus (RHCSA-Aligned Operations)

- Service failure simulation and recovery using systemd and journalctl  
- Storage lifecycle management (LVM expansion and filesystem resizing)  
- SELinux troubleshooting and context restoration  
- Scheduled administrative tasks and maintenance automation  
- Host-based logging and auditing practices  

## Future Security Enhancements

- Standardized system hardening approaches  
- Centralized logging and audit trail design  
- Structured vulnerability remediation workflows  
- Repeatable configuration patterns for secure server deployments  

The goal is to reinforce strong Linux operational capability first, then progressively layer security practices on top of that foundation.
